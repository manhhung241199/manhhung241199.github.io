        <span class="class_three">After I completed the research, I gained more experience and insight to draw lessons
            for
            later research. So, in
            this report, I will look back and learn some lessons from my research after 3 months. Specifically, the
            difficulties, experiences, shortcomings need to be corrected and self-aware when conducting the last
            research.
            Specifically, in this report, I will give the conditions that the project proposal, the research process
            have
            helped me complete my research. In addition, I also need to reflect on the advantages, disadvantages, and
            potential pitfalls of the method I have chosen. Besides, I will give the role of Literature review in my
            research. Furthermore, I will also give how I create the project plan, how often it is updated, and the
            reason
            why. In addition, I also gave the reason why I chose to participate and its importance in my research.
            Moreover,
            I also show how I present the results of my research. And finally, I will look at research methods and
            improvements in future research.</span><br>
