        <span>First released in '98, the Air Jordan OG was designed for the women's basketball community who wanted an AJ all of their own. The original Air Jordan for women has dimpled leather and midsole sculpting inspired by the AJ13.</span> <br> <br>
        <span>Air Jordan OG is a great night time strain that will help to wash away the stresses of your day. While everyone has a different preference, some may say that Air Jordan OG is pretty perfect with her 18% average THC content.</span> <br> <br>
        <span>The women’s Air Jordan OG originally released in 1998 and was the very first Brand Jordan model built exclusively for women.</span> <br></br>
