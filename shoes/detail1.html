        <span>More specifically, the yellow swoosh version has only 88 pairs (numbered from 1 to 88). This is a version for those who are close to G-Dragon and has letters and numbers written by him. More common is the international version with the white swoosh mark. The selling price of this version is about 200 USD. This is also a shoe model that is loved by the shoe fans and the international fan community. However, many people predict that owning this version with the original price is not easy.</span><br></br>
