        <span>One of the game's fiercest competitors, triple-double dynamo Russell Westbrook has the motor, muscle and mentality to match his fearlessness—with the stats to back it up. Built to hold up on outdoor courts, the Jordan "Why Not?" Zer0.3 PF is fine-tuned for players like Russ, who beat opponents with linear speed and aggressiveness.</span> <br> <br>
        <span>The Why Not Zer0. 3 is not a terrible performer overall, but the issues with lateral traction are a dealbreaker for me. Everything about this shoe is super solid.</span> <br> <br>
        <span>But the actual cushion performance should be the same level when playing basketball.</span> <br></br>
